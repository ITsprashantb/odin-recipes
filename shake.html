    <h3>Delicious milk shake</h3>
    <p>A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet beverage made by blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture.</p>
    <p>It may also be made using a base made from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk.</p>
